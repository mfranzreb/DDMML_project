Aufgabe: predict the number of remaining operational cycles before failure in the test set

CHaracteristics:
- Each dataset is from a different engine which starts with different degrees of initial wear and manufacturing variation
- There are three operational settings that have a substantial effect on engine performance, included in the data.
- Each enginge develops a fault during the series, In the training set, the fault grows in magnitude until system failure. 
  In the test set, the time series ends some time prior to system failure.
